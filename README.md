# Shiftania
The source code for shiftania, the game i submitted to the MVM 21. Development is currently going on.Things i plan to do:

- Fix bug with tile edges where player rockets off into the sky (lol don't worry it's rare)

- Fix long load and restart times for levels

- Fix very laggy death particle system

- (Maybe) add tile collisions for magical attacks?
  
- Add 3-4 more levels

- Improve current level deisgn to make it more puzzle-like and interesting

I will not be adding a coyote timer. This is a bit like geometry dash in metroidvania style, it's a precision platformer to a large extent. It's a convenience, not a handicap, to keep a constant jump distance (I tried adding a coyote timer and the game just became too hard and plain frustrating at times because I had to press space for precisely the right duration at every jump).
